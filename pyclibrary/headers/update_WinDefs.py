Windows headers are not included in this distribution due to possible
copyright issues. Thus there is the cache file 'WinDefs.cache' here
which encapsulate definitions pulled from several headers included
in Visual Studio

This script updates the WinDefs.cache file.
It has to be run on one of the following conditions:
* another Visual C/C++ compiler version is used
* the object model of the parser was updated.
