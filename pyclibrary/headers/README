Windows headers are not included in this distribution due to possible copyright issues. 
However, there is a cache file here which encapsulates definitions pulled from several
headers included in Visual Studio:
  BaseTsd.h  BaseTyps.h  WinDef.h  WinNt.h  WinUser.h  WTypes.h 

If you need to recompile the cache file, you can obtain these headers from any
Visual Studio installation.
