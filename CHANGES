PyCLibrary Changelog
====================

next release
------------

- python representations of C types/struct/enums and unions are stored in the
  special python classes now, instead of standard python tuples/dicts
- Pointers are represented as multiple 1-character ('*', '*', ...) entries
  in type-tuple instead of a single entry of multiple characters ('**...')
- BUGFIX: Type-qualifiers can now be specified in between pointer specifiers
  (i.e. ```int * volatile * volatile a``` dies work now)
- BUGFIX: CParser does not crash now, when passing a header-filename in the
  constructor
